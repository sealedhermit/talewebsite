    bio: I have my own comfortable world where I keep connecting dots and enjoy discovering life at my own sweet pace. My love for the pen and paper has long been converted into blogs for a few websites. Some stories and poems have been published between covers too. So, finally, I decided to own one myself, a digital memoir where I will share stories from my world. My friends did push me, I must add. My family, friends, books (fiction and poetry), paintings, food and travel make my world. My world also comprises of all things supernatural (from Shiv Thakur to Mamdo Bhoot). These are the things you will find at Monkatforty.com.
