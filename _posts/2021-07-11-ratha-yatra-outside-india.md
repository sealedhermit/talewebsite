## Introduction

Ratha Yatra outside India started in San Francisco, USA, in 1967. ISKCON’s founder Srila Prabhupada first started the ritual outside India which has spread across 192 countries today. Ratha Yatra (Chariot Parade) is a world famous Hindu festival concerning Lord Jagannath, his brother Balram or Balabhadra and their sister Subhadra. It originated in India at Puri, Odisha, over 600 years ago and is celebrated across the whole of India. Baring Antartica, Ratha Yatra is celebrated in every other continent, mostly through ISKCON (International Society of Krishna Consciousness), Hindu Societies and/or Jagannath/ Oriya Temple Societies.

## Ratha Yatra, the festival

The priests carry the deities out of the temple and place them on their respective Rathas (chariots) or a single ratha. Devotees gather firstly to pull the chariot’s rope as a step to salvation or moksha. Secondly, they sing, chant, dance, play drums (khol), khanjanis, flutes, harmoniums and even modern western musical instruments. Third, tasty prasadam is distributed. Indian cultural functions take place. It is said that the British officers from East India Company were awestruck with the overwhelming aura and pompousness of the festival at Puri. Hence, they coined the term, ‘Juggernaut’, meaning ‘a huge, powerful, irresistible and overwhelming force’. Lord Jagannath, another form of Lord Krishna, was already known to the west. So the festival of Ratha Yatra outside India spread across the globe in almost no time at all.
